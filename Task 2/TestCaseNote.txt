NOTE: for some odd reason, my computer doesn't recognize the dataset file path anymore. 
All the python scripts for Task 2 was running fine and no errors; however, just yesterday
and today (as on August 17 and 18). The script wasn't recognizing the file path anymore, 
and there wasn't a slight change in my code scripts nor I had moved the dataset around. So, 
therefore, I was unable to make a test case for Task 2 unfortunately.I was using the latest 
version of Sypder with Python 3.7.
